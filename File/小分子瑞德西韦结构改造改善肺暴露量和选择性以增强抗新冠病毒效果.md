COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms still lack antiviral treatment options. Although remdesivir is the only FDA approved drug for those patients, its efficacy is limited by premature hydrolysis to nucleoside (NUC), low accumulation in the disease-targeted tissue (lungs), and low antiviral potency. In this study, we synthesized a new series of remdesivir analogues by modifying the ProTide moiety. In comparison with remdesivir, the lead compound MMT5-14 showed 2- to 7-fold higher antiviral activity in four variants of SARS-CoV-2. By reducing premature hydrolysis in hamsters, MMT5-14 increased the prodrug concentration by 200- to 300-fold in the plasma and lungs but also enhanced lung accumulation of the active metabolite triphosphate nucleosides (NTP) by 5-fold. Compared to remdesivir, MMT5-14 also increased the intracellular uptake and activation in lung epithelial cells by 4- to 25-fold. These data suggest that MMT5-14 could be a potential antiviral drug to treat COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms.
