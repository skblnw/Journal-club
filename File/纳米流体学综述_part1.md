## Notes:
An old but important review that illustrated the basic ideas of nanofluidics. Only some important concepts are noted.

## Introduction: 
Nanofluidics explore the transport phenomena of fluidics at the nanoscales, where the traditional continuous description of fluidics failed. The traditional models rely on the assumption of the separation of length and time scales between the investigated length scale and the 'molecular' dynamics, in such case the fast molecular motions are averaged and only left several degrees of freedom such as pressure and temperature. Such average, in general, can be summarized by the Green-Kubo equation (e.g., $η = (1 / VK_bT) ∫⟨σ_xy(t)σ_xy(0)⟩ dt$). As the time length is far large than the microscopic time scales $τ_σ$, the correlation function of stress can be well approximated by a delta function. For water molecules, such time scale is about $10^-12$ s. Thus, the critical length scale for water is about 1 nm.

## Section 1: Molecular length scale (water/ion channel, dewetting transition....)
At the smallest scales, the granularity of the fluid and its components (solvent, ions, dissolved species, ...) should play a role. For water molecules, such length scale is about 3 Å. Many important biophysics phenomena emerge in this length scale, such as fast water transport of porins and the ion selectivity of ion channels. Also, it's important for many artificial nanofluidics devices such as nanopores.

## Section 2: Electrostatic length scales and their dynamic influence
### Bjerrum length (ion pairs in nanopore and nanoslits)
Bjerrum length lb is used to describe the interaction of ion pairs, where $V_el(l_B) = K_bT$. Thus, $l_B = (z^2e^2) / (4πεK_bT)$. In bulk water, such length is about 1 nm. However, due to the fact that nanoconfined water has an anomalous low dielectric constant (the rotation of water on some dimensions is limited), in some special cases, such length can be larger than 10 nm.

### Debye length (many-body effect in nanopore ion transport)
Debye length $l_D$ is used to describe the electrostatic screening in the bulk electrolyte. Many artificial nanopores and natural porins have a length scale of about 1 nm, such crossover of length scale results in nonlinear ion transport phenomena.

## Section 3: Slip length and friction
The so-called slip length, b, characterizes the hydrodynamic boundary condition of a fluid at its confining interfaces. As the nanopore size is compared with b, the transport of fluidics can be enhanced by surface slip.
